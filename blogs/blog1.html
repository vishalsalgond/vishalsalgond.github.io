        <p class="mt-4 lead">The Apple iPhone is one of the leading product in smartphone market, yesterday Apple
            revealed
            their all new iPhones which kind of look and feel similar to previous generation of iPhones.

        <p class="my-5 lead">Like every year, this year also in the first half of the September Apple introduced the all
            new iPhones with slightly bigger screens, faster speeds and better cameras but to be honest there were no
            new major changes.

            In a prerecorded video of the event, Apple executives claimed the improvements in the new iPhone 13 as
            significant
            innovations, but they result in a device that looks and performs much like the iPhone 12 that Apple launched
            last year.

            Apple promised that the new iPhones will have a much more brighter screen, a longer battery life and much
            more powerful camera and
            processors. Having already pushed the screen nearly to the edge of the device, Apple slightly
            increased the size of the new iPhone 13 by shrinking down the huge notch at the top of the screen. Apple
            kept the same flat-edge
            design of the phone that it has used in other recent models.
        </p>

        <p class="my-5 lead">Apple hopes that by adding these so called new features and making some slight design improvements,
            customers will still keep throwing extra money. Though this strategy of apple has worked in favour of apple for a long time.
            The iPhone completed 14 years this year and it still remains one the world's best selling smartphones and the biggest
            cashsow for Apple every year. Over the first half of the year, the latest period available, Apple said iPhone sales rose 58
            percent to $87.5 billion over the same period a year earlier.

            This huge success of Apple is majorly because the have built a very huge loyal customer base and also because they have
            designed and built their products such that it makes customers really difficult to switch to other competitors like Samsung, OnePlus
            or Google. Having said that iPhone still remains among the best sellig smarhones in terms of design, user experience,
            built quality and innivation.

            During the entire event, Apple emphasized a lot on iPhone’s new “cinematic mode”. A camera technology
            that can automatically follow and focus on a subject, which results in videos that more closely resemble the
            professional movies.

            Throughout the video Apple emphasized on the advanced camera technology in the new iPhones is a reflection
            of their huge investment in Artificial Intelligence technology to compete with Google.
