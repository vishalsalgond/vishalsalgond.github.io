        <p class="mt-4 lead">The iPhone remains among the best smartphones on the market in several areas, including
            camera
            technology and
            screen resolution.</p>

        <p class="my-5 lead">It is a story that now happens just about every September: Apple introduced new iPhones
            that
            have slightly
            bigger screens, faster speeds and better cameras--but no new major advances.

            In a prerecorded infomercial, Apple executives framed the improvements in the new iPhone 13 as significant
            innovations, but they result in a device that looks and performs much like the iPhones that Apple touted
            last year.

            Apple said the new iPhones have a brighter screen, longer battery life and more powerful cameras and
            computer processors. Having already pushed the screen nearly to the edge of the device, Apple slightly
            increased its size by reducing the small notch at the top of the screen. Apple kept the same flat-edge
            design of the phone that it has used in other recent models.
        </p>

        <p class="my-5 lead">Apple is hoping that by adding new features and making slight design improvements,
            customers will keep shelling out more money. It is a strategy that has worked for a long time. The iPhone,
            now in its 14th year, remains one of the world’s best-selling products and the centerpiece of Apple’s
            business. Over the first half of the year, the latest period available, Apple said iPhone sales rose 58
            percent to $87.5 billion over the same period a year earlier.

            That success is partly because Apple has built an intensely loyal customer base, and also because it has
            designed its products in a way that makes it difficult for customers to switch to the competition, like
            Samsung and Google. The iPhone also remains among the best smartphones on the market in several areas,
            including camera technology and screen resolution.

            Apple spent much of its advertisement showing off the iPhone’s new “cinematic mode,” a camera technology
            that can automatically follow and focus on a subject, resulting in videos that more closely resemble
            professional movies.

            Apple’s emphasis on advanced camera technology in its iPhones is a reflection of its hefty investment in
            artificial intelligence to compete with Google.
